# 1. Introduction
In the Design Phase, we consider the behaviour of the system and detail its design.
Here, the software architecture is established, providing the framework of the various subsystems and the interaction between them. Building on the Analysis Phase, the Architecture Design introduces the corresponding interfaces of the predefined modules outlined in the previous phases. Additionally, this phase incorporates the Detailed Design which outlays the algorithms and data structures responsible for the operation of the product modules. 

## 1.1. Purpose
The Design Phase seeks to capture and document the specific data structures and workflows of the system in order to provide a detailed description of the project's design and automation. Once completed, the development team may proceed to the Implementation Phase. 

## 1.2. Intended Audience
The intended audience for Subby includes students in the Waterloo region who are either looking to sublet a place or are looking to rent their place out for a specified amount of time. 

## 1.3. Product Scope
The scope of Subby is driven by the need for a “one-stop shop” for Waterloo sublets. This will be done by creating, advertising and maintaining a sole website dedicated for finding and selling sublets. Achieving this will simplify an individual’s search to find a place for the school year while also aiding in an individual’s search for a renter. The finished product will be simple to use and easy to navigate through its various filters.  

## 1.4. Referencing Documents
* Requirements Documentation for Subby
* Analysis Documentation for Subby

# 2. Major Features
## 2.1. Create Sublet Listings
## 2.2. Browse/Search Sublet Listings

# 3. Design Considerations
## 3.1. Assumptions and Dependencies
* Users will have basic knowledge of how to use a computer
* Users will have a university email to register
* Google Maps API will be available for use

## 3.2. End-user Characteristics
* The ability for administrators to fix, update and maintain the website
* Users have the ability to filter their searches based on their needs
* Users are able to view available sublets on a map 
* Users can post their rooms for rent in addition to posting “wanted” ads 
* Users can rate other users based on their experiences
* Users are able to place a bid on properties they are interested in 

## 3.3. General Constraints
* Google Maps API Budget 
  * Daily free limit of 25,000 map loads 
	* $0.50 USD per 1,000 map loads over the daily free limit up to a maximum of 100,000 map loads
  * Subby administrators are trying to make the site as cost-effective as possible which will limit the site to a daily limit of 25,000 map loads 

## 3.4. Goals and Guidelines
* Comments will be used when coding
* All features in the design and analysis documents will be adhered to
* Any feature changes made to Subby will be documented
* All work done for the project will have SQA performed on them 

## 3.5. Development Methods
* Utilizing UML to organize and guide the code
* Performing SQA throughout the project to ensure correctness and thoroughness

# 4. Development Policies
## 4.1. Technical Standards and Guidelines
### 4.1.1. General Guidelines
* In general, problem-solving strategy and code formatting should follow the idiomatic approach of the language and tools used.

### 4.1.2. Technical Standards
* Code should be easily readable and as self-documenting as possible to enable ease of future maintenance.
  * Code should be DRY; functionality should be abstracted, rather than repeated, to avoid issues in maintenance.
* Methods that perform non-trivial operations should have a short comment with a description of their side-effects.
* Blocks within methods that are complex should have a short comment explaining their purpose.
* Frontend HTML and CSS must be in compliance with the established W3C standards.

### 4.1.3. Data Storage  
*	All objects will be organized into logical groups within one or more schemas in the database to maintain data organization and manageability 
*	Objects with in one schema should be accessible within another schema, assuming access is permitted 
*	Permit flexible and robust implementation of user defined objects, such as functions, data types, indexes and operators
*	Support a variety of data types, such as:
    * Boolean
    * Binary
    * Text (varchar, chart, text)
    * Date/Time
    * Enum
    * Array
    * User defined data type
    
    
### 4.1.4. Data Security 
*	Database must maintain the security and integrity of data housed with in it on several levels:
    * Access Control: 
        * Postgres ensures all files stored are protected from reading by any accounts other than the Admin
        * Access is granted or revoked on any object all the way down the column level 
        * User authentication is performed by backend server and postmaster who sanction permissions to users requesting access to dat
        * Each Postgres user account is assigned a username and is further secured with a password
        * Write access is limited to the Admin by default 
    * Data Integrity:
        * Foreign Keys
        * Primary Keys
        * Column constraints
        * Row Checks
        * UNIQUE, NOT NULL
        * Explicit Locks, Advisory Locks 
    * Data Recovery: 
        * Online backup
        * Point-in-time recovery using write-ahead logging 
        * Tablespaces
    * Concurrency Control:
        * Concurrency is managed through multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) and immunity to dirty reads 
        * Ensures each transaction is not visible to other transactions until committed 
        * Uphold ACID principles:
              * Three levels of transaction isolation are offered: read committed, repeatable read and serializable 
      
### 4.1.5. Control Flow 


See [Postgresql]( https://www.postgresql.org/about/) for more on database specs 


## 4.2 Project Deployment
* The deployment process will support starting the application on virtual server instances on Heroku. However it could run on a server using any OS that supports Python 3, as this is the runtime that Subby will use.
* Depending on the deployment configuration, the hosting server will also need to support a local Postgres database; alternatively, a separate server with a networked Postgres instance must be provided and reachable by the application server.

# 6. Project Architecture
## 6.1. Class Diagram
## 6.2. Package Details
As discussed in the Analysis Phase, the system consists of five packages: User Package, Sublet Package, Rating Package, Favourite Package, and Report Package. Within each package diagram, we list the relevant entity objects and their corresponding methods. Additionally, each package diagram includes the control objects responsible for realizing the major use cases representing the interactions between external actors and the system.

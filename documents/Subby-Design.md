## 1.2. Intended Audience

# 2. Major Features
## 2.1. Create Sublet Listings
## 2.2. Browse/Search Sublet Listings

# 3. Design Considerations

# 4. Development Policies
## 4.1. Technical Standards and Guidelines
### 4.1.1. General Guidelines
* In general, problem-solving strategy and code formatting should follow the idiomatic approach of the language and tools used.

### 4.1.2. Technical Standards
* Code should be easily readable and as self-documenting as possible to enable ease of future maintenance.
  * Code should be DRY; functionality should be abstracted, rather than repeated, to avoid issues in maintenance.
* Methods that perform non-trivial operations should have a short comment with a description of their side-effects.
* Blocks within methods that are complex should have a short comment explaining their purpose.
* Frontend HTML and CSS must be in compliance with the established W3C standards.

## 4.2 Project Deployment
* The deployment process will support starting the application on virtual server instances on Heroku. However it could run on a server using any OS that supports Python 3, as this is the runtime that Subby will use.
* Depending on the deployment configuration, the hosting server will also need to support a local Postgres database; alternatively, a separate server with a networked Postgres instance must be provided and reachable by the application server.

    * get\_last\_name():string
    * get\_first\_name():string
    * get\_phone\_number():string

* Setters (public)
    * set\_email(email: string)
    * set\_created\_at(date: datetime)
    * set\_updated\_at(date: datetime)
    * set\_is\_admin(is_admin: boolean)

* Helpers (private)
    * **Static:** hash_password(password: string) - Salts and hashes the given plaintext password.
    * validate\_password(password: string) - Ensure password meets specifications (e.x. 8 character minimum limit).
    * validate\_phone\_number(phonenumber: string) - Ensure that the phone number is of valid length and format.
    * validate\_email(email: string) - Validates the format of the given email.

* Relation Helpers (public)
    * save() - Runs the validation helpers, returning errors if present, and saves the User if it is valid.
    * reviews() - Returns an array of Reviews created by the User.

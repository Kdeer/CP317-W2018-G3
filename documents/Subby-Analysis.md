# 1. Introduction

Improving the current state of subletting would be beneficial to students throughout our target region, as we will be able to consolidate listings posted on non-specialized platforms, as well as provide quality assurance on the posted listings. The database of sublet listings will be organized based on standard filters for renting such as location, rating, etc.

The website will display the listing information found in the database in the form of text, diagrams, or maps. The website will allow administrators to insert, edit, and remove entries from the database/website at their discretion. A website user would be allowed access to the data on the front-end and browse through the listings on the site, as well as post new listings. 
## 1.1. Purpose
The current state of subletting is disorganized and , with the most popular platform being FaceBook--a site not even properly designed for posting sublets. Subby will allow for listings on FaceBook, Kijiji, and other sites to be consolidated and will be designed to fit the needs of a student subletter/sublessor

The idea is to provide:
1. **Subletters:**
    * Simple interface to browse through sublet listings, easily sorted using specialized filters.
    * Ability to contact sublessors through site or through provided contact information
    * Security in browsing since all listings will go through a verification process to confirm legitimacy.
2. **Sublessors:**
    * Ability to post new sublet listings according to site policy.
    * Ability to modify existing listings in case any information changes.
    * Allows for listings to be seen by verified users, and be contacted by these users.
    * Provide an interface to let one know the current competitive pricing in the property area.
3. **Administrators:**
    * All functionality available to users, as well as the ability to remove and edit any listing at their discretion.
# 2. Object Classification
Here we have provided all entity, boundary, and control objects found in all the Packages. These are broken down later in the Model Analysis.

## 2.1. Entity Objects

### 2.1.1. User

The User package contains the following:
* **Entity:** User
* **Controls:**
    * User Creator: Create and persist Users to the database.
    * User Manager: Edit and Destroy Users.
    * User Retriever: Retrieve single records of a User for display.
    * User Lister: List the index of Users.

As displayed in the Class Diagram, visitors are the only actors who will be able to use the User Creator view and controller. Administrators and regular users will be able to display accounts, and possibly edit them depending on their role.

### 2.1.2. Sublet

The Sublet package contains the following:
* **Entity:** Sublet
* **Controls:**
    * Sublet Creator: Create and persist Sublets to the database.
    * Sublet Manager: Edit and Destroy Sublets.
    * Sublet Lister: List the index of Sublets.
    * Sublet Searcher: Searches for Sublet records, taking params such as search query and page number.
    * Sublet Retriever: Retrieve single records of a Sublet for display.

Note that controllers such as the Sublet Manager will determine, based on User role, whether an actor has permission to edit or destroy a Sublet record. The Sublet Searcher controller will have no such authorization, as it is open to both visitors and regular users.

### 2.1.3. Rating

The Rating package contains the following:
* **Entity:** Rating
* **Controls:**
    * Rating Creator: Create and persist Ratings to the database.
    * Rating Manager: Edit and Destroy Ratings.
    * Rating Retriever: Retrieve single records of a Rating for display.

Note that both the User Display UI, Sublet Search UI, and Sublet Display UI will also use the Rating Retriever Control to display Rating information on their respective pages.

### 2.1.4. Favorite

The Favorite package contains the following:
* **Entity:** Favorite
* **Controls:**
    * Favorite Lister: Retrieve all of a User's Favorites to display the related Sublet listings.
    * Favorite Manager: Create and destroy Favorite entities.

The Sublet Search UI will display whether a Sublet listing has been "Favorited", and will access the Favorites Manager. 


## 2.2. Control Objects

## 2.3. Boundary Objects

## 2.4. Class Diagram

This class diagram shows an overall picture of the various actor interactions as well as controller/entity packages the GUI's pertain to. Note that some views will potentially retrieve data from more than one source- these have been indicated with dashed lines.

# 3. Requirements
## 3.1 Database
Administrators are allowed to modify website content when logged in, while general users may only view website content.
#### 3.1.1. Administrator Terms of Use
The administrator is one of two actors in the system, and is allowed to insert, edit, and remove users and content from the site.
#### 3.1.2. User Terms of Use
The user is the second of two actors in the system, and is allowed to insert content into the site and edit their inserted content.

# 4. Model Analysis

## 4.1. UML Diagram

This UML diagrams displays the various models required to accomplish the above use-cases, as well as their attributes and relations.

# 5. User Interface Specification
## 5.1. Task List
A sample task list for the administrator:
1. Logging into Subby management tool.
2. Creating a user.
3. Modifying an existing user's information.
4. Deleting a user.
5. Inserting a new sublet listing.
6. Modifying an existing sublet listing.
7. Deleting a sublet listing.
8. Logout.

A sample task list for the user:
9. Creating an account using Subby sign-up interface.
10. Logging into Subby using login interface. 
11. Viewing current sublet listings.
12. Filtering displayed listings.
13. Viewing specific listings.

### 5.1.1. Task Specifications
**Task 1: Logging into Subby management tool.**
The user has opened a web browser and has navigated to the Subby management tool log in page. The user enters valid admin credentials and logs in by selecting the "Login" button.

**Task 2: Creating a user. (Prerequisites: Task 1 as Administrator)**
The administrator selects the "Create User" which generates a overlayed display that prompts the administrator to fill in fields such as:
* Username
* Password
* E-mail Address
* Birth Date

The administrator enters the relevant information and selects the "Create" button. If the user information already exists in the database, there will be an error message saying that the entry is a duplicate, otherwise a notification will prompt the admin of successful user creation.

**Task 3: Modifying an existing user's information. (Prerequisites: Task 1 as Administrator, Task 2 if no users currently exist)**
The administrator looks at the current database of users, and selects the "Edit User" action next to a user entry. A new page will be loaded displaying the information of the selected user. The administrator will be prompted to edit any of:
* Username
* Password
* E-mail
* Birth Date

As well as the ability to see all listings currently posted by the selected user (The ability to complete task 6 and 7 is available here as well if there are available listings). The administrator enters and information changes desired, and presses the "Save" button at the bottom of the form. Should there be an error such as duplicate information in the database found, an error message will be displayed, otherwise the information should save. Alternatively, should the administrator deem no changes neccesary, there is a "Cancel" button next to the save to bring the administrator to their previous viewing page.

**Task 4: Deleting a user. (Prerequisites: Task 1 as Administrator, Task 2 if no users currently exist)**
The administrator will view all the users entered in the database, and select the "Delete User" button next to the data entry. This will issue a prompt asking for confirmation as to whether or not to proceed with the deletion. Should the administrator press "Confirm", the data entry will be removed from the database, else the administrator will press "Cancel" resulting in the prompt disappearing and no changes occurring to the database. Deleting a user will also remove all listings posted by said user.
